# Grow-A-garden-pet-spawner
The Grow a Garden Pet Spawner Script is a Lua-based script that automates the process of acquiring pets in the game. Normally, players would need to spend considerable time hatching eggs, completing tasks, and waiting to collect pets. With this script, however, you can instantly spawn any pet you desire, including rare ones.
